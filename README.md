Staq
======

Presentation
--------
Staq is a mini PHP framework.<br>
The main feature is that you can instantiate a stack of classes through all your extensions: <code>new \Stack\Model\User</code>,<br>
instead of instantiate a class of one extension: <code>new \My\Extension\Prefixes\Model\User</code>.

# It is **readable**: you do not have to write/read the vendor prefixes ;
# It is **fast**: you can start to use a stack even before defining it ;
# It is **maintanaible**: you can add classes to a stack whenever you want ;
# It is **extendable**: you can add an external extension to complete your own stack.
