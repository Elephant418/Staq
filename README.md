Staq
======
Staq is a mini PHP framework for maintainable website.


Overview
--------
Staq means "Stack query", it allow you to instanciate a stack of class.

Instead of directly instantiate: <code>new \Model\User</code> or <code>new \My_Software\Model\User</code>)<br>
You can instantiate a stack: <code>new \Stack\Model\User</code>.

It's great because :

* You can instantiate a stack even before it have classes ;
* You can add classes to a stack when ever you want ;
* You can install an external extension to complete your own stack ;
* The stacks are powerfull, but still readable.
