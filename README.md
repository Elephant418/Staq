Staq
======

Presentation
--------
Staq is a mini PHP framework.<br>
The main feature is that you can instantiate a stack of classes through all your extensions: <code>new \Stack\Model\User</code>,<br>
instead of instantiate a class of one extension: <code>new \My\Extension\Prefixes\Model\User</code>.

1. **Readable**: you do not have to write/read the vendor prefixes ;
2. **Fast**: you can start to use a stack even before defining it ;
3. **Maintanaible**: you can add classes to a stack whenever you want ;
4. **Extendable**: you can add an external extension to complete your own stack.
