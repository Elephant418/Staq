Staq
======
Staq is a mini PHP framework for a enjoyable web development.



Features
--------


### Stack
The main feature is that you can instantiate a stack of classes through all your extensions: <code>new \Stack\Model\User</code>,<br>
instead of instantiate a class of one extension: <code>new \My\Extension\Prefixes\Model\User</code>.

1. **Reduce weight**: you have a light syntax with more meaning ;
2. **Reduce dependency**: you can start to use a stack even before defining it ;
3. **Increase reusability**: you can add an external extension to complete your own stack.
