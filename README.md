Staq
======

Modular & maintainable website
--------
Staq is a mini PHP framework for modular & maintainable website.<br>
Staq means "Stack query", it allow you to instantiate a stack of classes through several extensions.

Instead of directly instantiate a class: <code>new \Model\User</code> or <code>new \My_Extension\Model\User</code>,<br>
You can instantiate a stack: <code>new \Stack\Model\User</code>.

It's great because :

* You can instantiate a stack even before defining his classes ;
* You can add classes to a stack when ever you want ;
* You can add an external extension to complete your own stack ;
* The stacks are powerfull, but still readable.
